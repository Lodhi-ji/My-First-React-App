# 🎯 First React App

This project is a beginner-friendly **React** application built to understand and practice the fundamentals of React, including **components**, **JSX**, **props**, **state**, **hooks**, **conditional rendering**, and **event handling**. It combines multiple interactive elements into a single UI to showcase how different React features work together.

## 🌟 Features

- 🖼️ **Cards Section**  
  Displays 4 image-based cards using props to dynamically render content.

- ➕➖ **Counter Functionality**  
  A counter with increment and decrement buttons using `useState`.

- 🔁 **Toggle Button**  
  Toggles visibility of content using conditional rendering.

- 🧾 **Form Section**  
  A basic input form to collect the user's name (demonstrating form handling).

- 🧭 **Header (Navbar)**  
  Navigation bar with links to "Home", "About", and "Contact".

- 📄 **Footer**  
  A simple footer with your copyright.
